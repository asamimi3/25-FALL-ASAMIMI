this past week i was out sick on monday, however i did clean up and edit
some of my eda jupyter notebook, but then my trial on pycharm ended and i 
was not aware that jupyter was part of the pro, so i had to make a new .py 
sheet. i then moved my new code to the .py, and i
- cleaned it
- edited it
- made some adjustments
- explored more data
- started making plots in tableau
