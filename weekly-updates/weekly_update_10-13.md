The last week I have been working on finalizing my data cleaning. 
I have gotten to know my data a lot more while tidying
- was able to harmonize data 
- sync coloumn names 
- convert to binary

Now that i have four tidy parquets, my next steps this coming week will be to
confirm and spot check the key columns then to begin on some plots.
